# Scripts_metagenomic_signatures

This folder contains scripts written in Perl, which were used in metagenomic study.
The scripts were created for personal use only considering only the preferences of the authors. Each script works correctly and perfectly 
does the its specific task. Though, the logics of using them can be obvious only to the authors.
Therefore, they it may be challenging for other users to run them.
